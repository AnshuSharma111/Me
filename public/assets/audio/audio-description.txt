Audio Assets Specifications

The audio for the "Me" app should create a gentle, ambient atmosphere that enhances the reflective journaling experience without being distracting.

## Ambient Background Loops

Create short (10-30 second) loopable ambient tracks that can play continuously in the background.

1. main-loop.mp3
   - A neutral, calming ambient background
   - Soft synth pads or gentle piano notes
   - Very subtle, almost imperceptible rhythm
   - Should loop seamlessly

2. Emotion-specific ambient loops (optional):
   - calm-loop.mp3: Gentle flowing water or soft wind chimes
   - joy-loop.mp3: Light, airy tones with subtle brightness
   - melancholy-loop.mp3: Soft minor key progression, gentle rain
   - anxiety-loop.mp3: Slightly tense but not uncomfortable tones
   - hope-loop.mp3: Rising, optimistic gentle progression
   - wonder-loop.mp3: Spacious, ethereal tones with slight sparkle
   - gratitude-loop.mp3: Warm, resonant tones with gentle harmony

## Interaction Sounds

Create very short (0.5-2 second) sound effects for user interactions:

1. click.mp3
   - Soft, subtle click for button interactions
   - Not sharp or harsh

2. submit.mp3
   - Gentle confirmation sound for submitting journal entries
   - Slightly more prominent than regular clicks

3. reflection-appear.mp3
   - Soft reveal sound for when the poetic reflection appears
   - Gentle rising tone or chime

4. ornament-place.mp3
   - Delicate sound for when an ornament is placed on the tree
   - Soft chime or gentle bell
