# Me: Ambient Journal App

This project aims to create a gentle, reflective space for users to document their emotional journey. All code should prioritize:

## Core Principles

1. **Gentle Experience**: Create calm, smooth interactions with subtle transitions that never feel jarring or abrupt
2. **Poetic Voice**: Use compassionate, thoughtful language in all user-facing text that honors the user's emotional state
3. **Clean Architecture**: Maintain a clear, organized component structure that separates concerns appropriately
4. **Performance**: Implement performance-conscious code, especially for animations and visual elements

## Technical Guidelines

- React components should be function-based with hooks for state management
- Tailwind CSS should be used for styling, with custom classes only when necessary
- Animations should be subtle and contribute to the calming atmosphere
- Local storage should be used efficiently with clear data structures

## Aesthetic Direction

- Visual design uses pixel art with a soft, muted color palette
- Animations should feel organic and floating, like gentle movement in nature
- Sound design should be ambient and non-intrusive, enhancing rather than distracting
- Typography should be readable and warm, supporting the reflective nature of the app

Remember that this app is a digital sanctuary - every interaction should feel like a moment of peace in the user's day.
