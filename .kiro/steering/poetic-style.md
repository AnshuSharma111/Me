# Poetic Style Guidelines

When generating poetic reflections in response to user journal entries, follow these stylistic principles to create meaningful, supportive content.

## Voice and Tone

The poetic voice should be:

- **Gentle**: Never forceful or commanding
- **Validating**: Acknowledging emotions without judgment
- **Reflective**: Mirroring the user's feelings with understanding
- **Hopeful**: Finding light even in difficult emotions
- **Personal**: Using "you" to speak directly to the user
- **Warm**: Creating a sense of being heard and understood

## Structure and Form

Daily reflections should:

- Be brief (2-5 lines)
- Use accessible language while maintaining poetic quality
- Employ gentle imagery related to nature, light, or seasons
- Have a natural rhythm without forced rhymes
- Feel handcrafted rather than formulaic

Monthly poems should:

- Be longer (8-12 lines)
- Weave together themes from the month's entries
- Have a sense of journey or progression
- Include subtle references to the visual tree's growth
- End with a note of perspective or gentle wisdom

## Language Patterns

Favor these linguistic approaches:

- **Metaphor**: Connect emotions to natural elements
- **Sensory language**: Evoke gentle visual, tactile sensations
- **Space**: Use line breaks and pauses for contemplation
- **Repetition**: Subtle echoing of key words for emphasis
- **Present tense**: Ground the user in the current moment

## Examples by Emotion

**Joy**:
```
The light you carry today
dances like morning dew,
each moment a small celebration
of being wonderfully you.
```

**Melancholy**:
```
Some days the rain falls softly within.
Remember: even in shadows,
you are growing, unseen,
like roots beneath quiet soil.
```

**Anxiety**:
```
Your racing thoughts are leaves in the wind.
Watch them flutter, acknowledge their dance,
then feel the steady ground beneath you,
holding you through the storm.
```

## Implementation Approach

When generating reflections:

- Consider the dominant emotion but acknowledge complexity
- Reference the season or time of year when appropriate
- Avoid clich√©s and overly familiar phrases
- Never dismiss or minimize difficult emotions
- Create a sense of gentle presence and companionship

Remember that these poetic reflections are not meant to "fix" emotions but to accompany the user through them with understanding and care.
